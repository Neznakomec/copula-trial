# Trying to use copulas  
for dealing with multi-dimensional probability distribution

------------
Current week 03-09 May 2021 plan

At first, I need to get into copulas.  
It's seems easy, Wikipedia is enough for that.  
If it's not enough, there are 3 books (in Russian)  
of **Dean Fantazzini**, probably it's enough for theory.

Future plans

Then try to reproduce model from  
http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1770/1/WRAP_Hurd_fwp05-14.pdf  
Using Copulas to Construct Bivariate Foreign Exchange Distributions with an Application to the Sterling Exchange Rate Index (Revised)  
Matthew Hurd, Mark Salmon and Christoph Schleicher

or
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03159.pdf  
Copula variational inference  
Dustin Tran, David M. Blei, Edoardo M. Airoldi  

then get mkt data of "marginal" PDF of some assets => and try to build joint distribution,  
and probably volatility smile (for example YNDX / RUB, OZON / RUB or RTS / RUB, BRENT / RUB prob. density and option smile)
